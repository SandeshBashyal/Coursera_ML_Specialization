Here are the steps to run the django project

A. Install Django
# Install python from website, I have pyenv for different python versions
# Go to the terminal and install virtualenv, but before you need to install pip if not installed while installing python
-> pip install --upgrade pip
-> pip install virtualenv
-> python -m venv _________(name of the project, here in my case it is virenv as vir(tual)env(ironment))
-> virenv\Scripts\activate
# so create your your virtualenv, you can see it in .gitignore. To create a file .gitignore:
-> Install git bash
-> In git bash, touch .gitignore
-> write the folders and file name in .gitignore that you don't want to push in github.
# let's create django app and we will push it in github.
